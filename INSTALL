Quick & dirty install
based on what author told us on IRC :P

1) cmake . ; make

2) as root:  make install

3) cd test

4) g++ -o routes.so -shared routes.cpp blog.cpp  -fPIC -g3 ; /usr/local/milx/bin/milx.cgi

Step 4 recompiles and runs the test.

(Probably need restar from step 1 to see changes in the library)
